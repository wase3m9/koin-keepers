        <p class="text-blue-800">Cryptocurrency is digital money that uses advanced encryption to secure transactions. Unlike traditional currency, it's decentralised and operates independently of banks or governments. In the UK, crypto is treated as property for tax purposes, not currency.</p>

        <p>If you've been hearing about Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies and wondering what all the fuss is about, you're not alone. With over 2.3 million UK adults now owning cryptocurrency according to the FCA, it's becoming increasingly mainstream.</p>

        <p>But what exactly is cryptocurrency? And more importantly for UK residents, what do you need to know before diving in?</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-cryptocurrency" class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
        
        <p>Think of cryptocurrency as <strong>digital cash</strong> that exists only online. But unlike the pounds in your bank account, cryptocurrency doesn't rely on banks or the Bank of England to verify transactions.</p>

        <p>Instead, it uses something called <strong>blockchain technology</strong> - a digital ledger that's maintained by thousands of computers around the world. This makes it:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Decentralised:</strong> No single authority controls it</li>
          <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Extremely difficult to hack or counterfeit</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> All transactions are publicly recorded</li>
          <li><strong>Global:</strong> Can be sent anywhere in the world, 24/7</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how-cryptocurrency-works" class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">The Blockchain Explained Simply</h3>
        
        <p>Imagine a notebook that records every transaction, but instead of one person keeping it, thousands of people have identical copies. When someone wants to make a transaction:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>They announce it to the network</li>
          <li>The network checks they have enough cryptocurrency to spend</li>
          <li>The transaction gets added to a new "page" (block) in everyone's notebook</li>
          <li>Once everyone agrees, the transaction is complete and permanent</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Popular Cryptocurrencies in the UK</h3>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

          <li><strong>Start small</strong> - only invest what you can afford to lose</li>
          <li><strong>Consider a hardware wallet</strong> for larger amounts</li>
          <li><strong>Never share your private keys</strong> with anyone</li>
