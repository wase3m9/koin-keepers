          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What Are NFTs?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">NFTs are unique digital assets stored on blockchain technology. They can represent art, music, videos, in-game items, and more. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, NFTs are not interchangeable due to their uniqueness. This distinct nature means they often fall under different tax rules compared to other digital assets.</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Taxable Events in NFT Trading</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">In most jurisdictions, the following NFT-related activities are considered taxable events:</p>

          <div class="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Buying NFTs:</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Purchasing NFTs using cryptocurrency is often a taxable event because it involves the disposal of the cryptocurrency. The gain or loss is calculated based on the cryptocurrency's market value at the time of the transaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Selling NFTs:</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Selling NFTs for cryptocurrency or fiat currency (like USD or GBP) typically triggers Capital Gains Tax (CGT) or Income Tax, depending on whether the activity is classified as personal investment or business income.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Trading NFTs:</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Swapping one NFT for another is considered a disposal, potentially triggering CGT or similar taxes.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Earning NFTs:</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Receiving NFTs as payment for goods or services, or through airdrops, is treated as taxable income. The value of the NFT at the time of receipt is subject to Income Tax.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Staking NFTs or Earning Royalties:</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Staking NFTs to earn rewards or receiving royalties from secondary sales can also create taxable income events.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Tax Implications by Jurisdiction</h2>
          
          <div class="space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. United States:</h3>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                <li>Capital Gains Tax: Applies to profits from selling or trading NFTs. Short-term gains (held less than a year) are taxed at regular income tax rates, while long-term gains benefit from lower rates.</li>
                <li>Income Tax: Applies to NFTs received as income, valued at the time of receipt.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. United Kingdom:</h3>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                <li>Capital Gains Tax (CGT): Selling NFTs or using cryptocurrency to buy them triggers CGT. Rates are 10% for basic rate taxpayers and 20% for higher rate taxpayers, with a Â£6,000 tax-free allowance for 2024.</li>
                <li>Income Tax: Applies to NFTs earned through staking, royalties, or as payment for services.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. European Union:</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-600">Tax treatment varies by country, but most align with principles of taxing cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">For example, Germany exempts long-term gains on crypto (held over a year), which may apply to NFT-related transactions.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">4. Other Regions:</h3>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                <li>Australia: NFTs are treated similarly to cryptocurrencies, with CGT applying to disposals and Income Tax on earnings.</li>
                <li>Canada: Transactions are taxed based on whether the activity is personal or business-related, with capital gains or business income rules applying accordingly.</li>
              </ul>
