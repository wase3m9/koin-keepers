<h2>Why this matters in 2025</h2>

<p>HMRC is getting far better data from exchanges and platforms. If your records don't line up with what HMRC receives, you stand out. That's when penalties, interest, and enquiries become real problems.</p>

<h2>The 5 pitfalls</h2>

<h3>1) Misreporting complex transactions</h3>

<p>Common trouble spots:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wallet transfers where fees are paid in crypto</li>
  <li>DeFi rewards that might be income or capital depending on facts</li>
  <li>NFT mints, burns, and royalties</li>
  <li>Airdrops, forks, liquidity events</li>
</ul>

<p>One wrong assumption can skew hundreds of lines.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Use UK-specific rules, document your treatment for each activity, and get a specialist review if you've touched DeFi or NFTs.</p>

<h3>2) Broken cost basis across wallets, CEX and DEX</h3>

<p>Typical errors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Duplicated trades from both API and CSV</li>
  <li>Missing historical prices or token rebrands</li>
  <li>Fees logged in the wrong asset</li>
  <li>Ignoring UK Section 104 pooling and same-day/30-day matching</li>
</ul>

<p>End result: gains overstated, losses understated, or both.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Consolidate data into one system, reconcile internal transfers to zero, and run a pooling check before you file.</p>

<h3>3) Leaving reliefs and allowances on the table</h3>

<p>People overpay by missing loss claims, spouse or civil partner transfers, timing disposals badly, or failing to claim legitimate costs.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Plan disposals, crystallise losses correctly, and review elections and reliefs before year end.</p>

<h3>4) Higher enquiry and penalty risk</h3>

<p>Returns that don't reconcile with platform reports or show obvious anomalies invite questions. If HMRC decides you were careless, penalties and interest stack up quickly.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Keep an evidence pack with exports, chain proofs, pricing sources, and a short position note explaining key judgements.</p>

<h3>5) Grey areas for staking, mining and business activity</h3>

<p>Frequent trading can look like a trade rather than investment. Staking may be income or capital. Holding crypto in a company raises accounting and disclosure issues.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Separate personal and company wallets, classify activities with clear criteria, and apply consistent treatment backed by notes.</p>

<h2>What a specialist actually does</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>End-to-end reconciliation:</strong> Cleans duplicates, fills price gaps, standardises formats</li>
  <li><strong>Correct UK treatment:</strong> Pooling, matching, income vs capital, corporate rules</li>
  <li><strong>DeFi/NFT mapping:</strong> Rewards, LP moves, bridging, wrapping, royalties</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence pack:</strong> Workpapers, exportable logs, position note for HMRC</li>
  <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Timing disposals, using spouse allowances, corporate structuring where suitable</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIY anyway? Use this safer workflow</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Map every source:</strong> All exchanges, wallets, chains, DEX, NFTs, bots, and dormant accounts</li>
  <li><strong>Lock raw data:</strong> Export CSVs and PDFs and keep read-only copies</li>
  <li><strong>Import with rules:</strong> Avoid auto-guessing where possible; tag uncertain items</li>
  <li><strong>Reconcile transfers and fees:</strong> Internal transfers net to zero; gas booked to the right asset and date</li>
  <li><strong>Document judgement calls:</strong> One-page note on how you treated staking, LP, airdrops, NFTs</li>
  <li><strong>Sanity check totals:</strong> No unrealised positions in gains; fiat flows align with bank records</li>
  <li><strong>Get a pre-file review:</strong> A single caught error often pays for the review</li>
</ol>

<h2>2025 quick tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Consolidate platforms where you can</li>
  <li>Use a dedicated crypto inbox for statements and confirmations</li>
  <li>Tag transactions monthly</li>
  <li>Keep company and personal completely separate</li>
  <li>Track stablecoin hops so cost basis stays intact</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples we fix a lot</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gas never booked:</strong> ETH fees ignored, gains inflated</li>
  <li><strong>Double imports:</strong> API plus CSV creates phantom disposals</li>
  <li><strong>All staking set as interest:</strong> Wrong tax head and timing</li>
  <li><strong>Company wallet mix-ups:</strong> Personal wallets used for company buys</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Do I need a specialist if I only used one exchange?</h3>
<p>Not always. You still need correct UK pooling and fee treatment. A one-off review can be enough.</p>

<h3>Are DeFi rewards always income?</h3>
<p>No. It depends on the protocol and your rights. Facts matter.</p>

<h3>Can software do it all?</h3>
<p>Software helps, but it guesses. Someone must validate, fix misclassifications, and document edge cases.</p>

<h3>What if I'm missing records?</h3>
<p>Rebuild from chain explorers, bank statements, and exchange exports. Add a clear methodology note and keep it consistent.</p>

<h3>What if I hold through a company?</h3>
<p>Corporate rules apply. Keep wallets separate and follow the right accounting and disclosure steps.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>You can file yourself. The risk rises with more wallets, protocols, and years of activity. If you're beyond simple buys and sells, a specialist usually costs less than a mistake.</p>
